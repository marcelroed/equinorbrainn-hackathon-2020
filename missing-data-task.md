## Task description
A wind farm generates a lot of data. Unfortunately, not always the quality of data is good enough. One of the biggest problems is missing data, and the first step to approach the problem is Missing Data Analysis.

Our Data Platform department has prepared a data set containing turbine sensor time series  for a certain period. Can you find patterns in the missing data? Perhaps some tags and/or turbines can be separated?

Meaning of data and tag semantics is not important in the context of this task.

Each time series is represented by a data set feature (column), with the following name pattern:
"T<turbine_number>-<tag_name>"
E.g. "T04-ActiveEnergyExport" means Turbine: 04, Tag: "ActiveEnergyExport"

The data file (NB! 1,7Gb csv) will be distributed via [Slack](https://equinorbrainn-hy21669.slack.com/).

## Delivery

Delivery shall be made via [Web Site](https://equibrainhackahton2020.azurewebsites.net/missingdata), choose "Upload optional task" link. Delivery must be packed in a zip file and would contain answer along with your notes in free format (e.g. text, jupyter notebook, MSWord), as well as any supporting material you find necessary. 

File Name: ```missingdata_<number_of_the_round>_<team-name>.zip.``` 

Example: ```missingdata_1_teamname.zip```


Delivery deadline is 08.03.2020 09:00.

It is possible to make several delivires. Only the latest one will be considered.

## Scoring:
